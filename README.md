Blog Application with Docker and CI/CD
Overview
This project is a Laravel-based blog application that leverages Docker for easy environment setup and GitHub Actions for CI/CD integration. It includes a PHP application running on Apache, a MySQL database, SSL certificate handling with Certbot, and optionally an Nginx reverse proxy for HTTP to HTTPS redirection.

Prerequisites
Docker: Make sure Docker is installed on your machine. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system at Docker's website.
Docker Compose: Ensure you have Docker Compose installed. It typically comes with Docker Desktop installations.
Running the Application Locally
Clone the Repository:

https://github.com/Mustafiz420/blog-app.git
cd blog-app
Set Up the Environment:

Copy the example environment configuration:
cp .env.example .env
Open .env file and modify the necessary keys if needed, especially database credentials.
Run Docker Compose:

Build and start the containers:

docker-compose up --build
This command will start all services defined in your docker-compose.yml, including PHP (with Apache), MySQL, Certbot, and optionally Nginx.
Access the Application:

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:80 for HTTP or https://localhost:443 for HTTPS (if SSL is configured with a valid domain instead of localhost).
CI/CD Setup
The CI/CD pipeline is set up with GitHub Actions to automate building, testing, and deploying the application.

Workflow Steps
Building and Testing:

Upon a push or pull request to the main branch, the following steps are executed:

Check Out Repository: Clone the repository to the runner.
Set Up Docker Buildx: Ensure Docker is ready to build images.
Cache Docker Layers: Save and restore the build cache to speed up subsequent builds.
Build Docker Image: Compose and build services defined in docker-compose.yml.
Run Tests: Execute Laravel tests within the app container.
Deployment:

If the build succeeds, the deploy job is triggered:

Set Up SSH for Secure Deployment: Access the remote server using SSH keys stored in GitHub Secrets.
Deploy to DigitalOcean Droplet: Connect to your server and deploy with Docker Compose.
Ensure your DigitalOcean Droplet (or other servers) is correctly configured to run Docker and has the necessary file permissions and SSH access. Adjust the server IP and path in the deploy job as required.

Security Considerations
Configure your .env file securely and prevent it from being shared or leaked.
Use strong secrets and consider rotating them regularly.
For production, ensure SSL certificates are correctly configured with real domains.
Optional Enhancements
Integrate alerts for CI/CD status using tools like Slack or email notifications.
Implement more advanced testing, including integration or end-to-end tests.
Utilize monitoring tools to track application performance in production.
Notes
Adapt Environment: The instructions assume usage of localhost. If deploying, ensure domain names and SSL certificates are configured for your environment.
Secrets Management: Store sensitive information like SSH keys and Docker Hub credentials in GitHub Actions Secrets for security.
SSH Configuration: SSH configurations should be adjusted as necessary to match your infrastructure and security protocols.
